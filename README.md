# Etch A Sketch

## Overview

**Etch A Sketch** is a creative web-based drawing application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum for learning web development.

The goal of the project was to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, layout design, and **Flexbox** to create an interactive and visually appealing sketching tool.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Drawing**  
  The grid is dynamically generated using JavaScript and can be resized using a slider and number input.

- **Colorful Flower Palette**  
  A 6-color palette is arranged in the shape of a **flower** to match the playful and colorful design. Each color can be customized by the user.

- **Random Color Mode**  
  A "Random" button enables color randomization while drawing.

- **Clear Button**  
  Resets the entire grid to its original blank state.

- **Eraser Tool**  
  Allows users to erase drawn colors by returning squares to white.

- **Darken Effect**  
  Each time the cursor passes over a colored square, it darkens by 10% until it becomes black.
